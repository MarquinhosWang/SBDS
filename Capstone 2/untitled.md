# **Used Car Price Prediction **
The COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020 and has changed many aspects of the world, and the used motor vehicle market has suffered a direct impact. A shortage of components causes a decrease in new car production due to a disrupted supply chain, therefore the value of the used car has skyrocketed since the pandemic. In this project, I will create a machine learning model that will predict used car prices using it's information.
